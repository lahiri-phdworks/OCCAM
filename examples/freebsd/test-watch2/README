This demo shows how to use occam2 watch to monitor code. The files
contain the following:

- main.c - the source file that will be watched.

- hooks.c - the source file that provides the hooks to run.

- main.hooks - the hooks file that describes how to monitor the program.

The build script generates two programs: main.watched and
main.unwatched which are the monitored and unmonitored versions of
main.


To build do:

occam ./build.sh
