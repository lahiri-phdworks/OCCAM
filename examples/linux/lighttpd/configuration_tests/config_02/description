The 'lighttpd' program was configured to NOT write error log to 'syslog'.

The 'server.errorlog-use-syslog' toggles the behavior mentioned above.

When the value of key 'server.errorlog-use-syslog' is 'disable' then the 
functions in the 'uncalled_functions' file are never called from anywhere 
else in the program.
