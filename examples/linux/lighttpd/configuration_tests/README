This directory contains the files which were involved in trying different configurations for the 'lighttpd' program
and the expected changes (because of the configuration changes) in the functions called or not called by the program.

The following describes the contents of this directory:

1) 'run.command': This file contains the command used to run the program with different configuration files
2) 'config_<num>': This directory contains files necessary to describe changes in program execution (with respect to
function calls) when a SINGLE feature is updated in a 'lighttpd' configuration file. The '<num>' is used to just
distinguish between different configuration files used. Each of these directories contains the following files:
        a) 'description': This file describes the feature that was updated
        b) 'lighttpd.conf': This is the configuration file used
        c) 'uncalled_functions': This is the file to describe the expected changes in program execution with respect
        to function calls. This file contains a list of function names in the 'lighttpd' program or in libc which would 
	NOT be executed because of the configuration file used. In this file each line is a function name	

*** CAVEAT ***
For each 'config_<num>' directory, the 'uncalled_functions' file describes only the functions which don't
get called because of the feature update described in its 'description' file. That means there could be more functions
(not listed in the 'uncalled_functions' file) which might not get called because of the configuration file for a given 
'config_<num>' directory. 
An example of this would be 'config_02' and 'config_04' directories. In 'config_02', the feature updated is 
the disabling of the application logging to 'syslog'. That causes only two functions to not get called and those are 
mentioned in its 'uncalled_functions' file. The configuration file for 'config_02' also contains the same subset of 
configuration (used to update a separate feature) which is described in 'config_04' directory. The functions that 
do not get called because of configuration update in 'config_04' are not listed in the 'uncalled_functions' file for 
'config_02' because 'config_02' describes a different feature.
